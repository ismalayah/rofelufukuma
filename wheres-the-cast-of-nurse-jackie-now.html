The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showtime</a> series ran for seven excellent seasons between 2009 and 2015, racking up awards and nominations thanks to its unflinching portrayal of topics like addiction and failing marriages, as well as a stellar cast doing a great job.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>The series follows Jackie Peyton (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Edie Falco</a>), a committed nurse in a New York emergency department who’s not afraid to bend (and often break) the rules for what she thinks is the greater good. Watching Jackie navigate her tough job, burgeoning addiction, and her failing marriage makes for compelling viewing, and the blend of humor and raw emotion makes it the sort of television that you can binge again and again.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>If you’ve been wondering what happened to the actors who elevated a great premise into an award winner, we got you covered.</p><h2 id=h-edie-falco-jackie-peyton data-injectable=false>Edie Falco (Jackie Peyton)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-183457671.jpg><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>When she joined the cast of Nurse Jackie, Edie Falco was already a household name and critical darling for her work on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sopranos</a>. Yet, even with this pedigree, she managed to exceed expectations in the role of Jackie. She was rewarded for her excellent performance as the titular character with her fourth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emmy</a>, and was nominated consistently for other honors throughout the show’s run.</p><p data-characters=915 data-current-count=1310 data-injectable=true>Since Nurse Jackie ended in 2015 Falco has been unsurprisingly busy. She’s taken on a few television jobs with a mixture of main parts and cameos, including a lead role in Louis C.K’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Horace and Pete</a>, playing Hillary Clinton in Impeachment: An American Crime Story, and appearing as herself in an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Impractical Jokers: Dinner Party</a>. However, the place you’re most likely to have seen her is on the big screen, where she played General Frances Ardmore, the new leader of the Resources Development Administration in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: The Way of the Water</a>. She’s also continued her stage career, appearing in 2018’s The True and 2021’s Morning Sun (both in New York City). In the near future, she’s set to star in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peacock</a> comedy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bupkis</a> alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Pesci</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pete Davidson</a>, although no release date has been set for the series that’s based on Davidson’s life.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Eve Best (Dr. Eleanor O’Hara)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1472012950.jpg><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=933 data-injectable=true>English actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eve Best</a> plays Jackie’s sardonic and brusque best friend Eleanor. The E.R. doctor is a British transplant and doesn’t actually seem to like her patients very much, but shares Jackie’s hatred of the broken system they both work in. Before her six seasons on the series, Eve was a successful and respected actor and director known mostly for her stage work, having picked up two Tony nominations and an Olivier Award (the British equivalent to a Tony). Audiences may have also recognized her from playing the role of American socialite Wallis Simpson in the Oscar-winning film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The King’s Speech</a>.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>After Nurse Jackie, Best has continued to act across multiple mediums. She played the lead female part of Mrs. Arbuthnot in a stage production of Oscar Wilde’s A Woman of No Importance, and repeated the role in a film adaptation of the play. However, in a global sense her most famous job since leaving Nurse Jackie is definitely her turn in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House of the Dragon</a>, where she plays the formidable Princess Rhaenys Targaryen. For now that’s her main job, but, as we all know, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of Thrones</a> universe is a dangerous place to be.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Merritt Wever (Zoey Barkow)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1204928631.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>Playing the part of the naively upbeat student nurse (and later full-time nurse and Jackie’s roommate) Zoey, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Merritt Wever</a> manages to show her character’s peppy attitude without being obnoxious. Zoey and Jackie’s is one of the most entertaining of the series, and Wever’s performance earned her an Emmy for her excellent work in season four.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Since Nurse Jackie, Wever has seen a lot of success. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Birdman</a> actress has appeared in the critically-acclaimed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marriage Story</a>, and her television work has seen her pick up another Emmy for her performance in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Godless</a>. She’s also been nominated for multiple awards for her turn in the heart-wrenching <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Unbelievable</a>. We look forward to seeing her in season two of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Severance</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Paul Schulze (Eddie Walzer)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-871111234.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>A drug dealing pharmacist who’s also Jackie’s affair partner (and eventual fiancè), Eddie Waltzer (Paul Schulze) is one of the best embodiments of Nurse Jackie’s amoral take on the broken American medical industry. The lovelorn hospital worker is a fantastic and efficient pusher, supplementing his income with the money made from hawking prescription drugs, but would also do almost anything for the titular character, often to his own detriment.</p><p data-characters=692 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Before Nurse Jackie, Schulze had a variety of high profile roles. He acted alongside Edie Falco in The Sopranos, and also had a major part in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">24</a>. Since playing Eddie, Schulze has had various roles in some popular shows, mixing it up with guest appearances and longer term parts, including a 12-episode arc on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Suits</a>, three episodes alongside Falco again in the short-lived police procedural <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tommy</a>, and a major role in the television series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Punisher</a>. In terms of the big screen, Shulze landed a role in the indie comedy drama Inside the Rain. With that said, the next time we’ll be able to see him is in the upcoming feature film The Requiem Boogie, which is currently in post production.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Peter Facinelli (Fitch “Coop” Cooper)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1431868016.jpg><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=799 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Facinelli</a> played Dr. Fitch “Coop” Cooper, an Ivy League graduate with an irritating mix of privilege and overconfidence. Even though he seems laidback (and makes everyone call him Coop), the audience soon learns his attitude is just a way of masking his own various insecurities. Although he and Jackie often have an antagonistic relationship, the pair’s relationship offers some of the funniest moments of the series, while also delivering some of the more sober points too.</p><p data-characters=734 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>Facinelli had been acting for well over a decade before taking on his role as Coop in Nurse Jackie, and was most famous for playing Edward’s adoptive father Dr. Carlisle Cullen in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight</a> films. He also had a recurring role in the critically acclaimed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO </a>series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Six Feet Under</a>. Since Nurse Jackie‘s finale, Facinelli has appeared in multiple film and television roles, including a part on the CBS show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Supergirl</a>. In 2020 he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in The Vanished, a psychological thriller about a missing girl. His next big project appears to be the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zachary Levi</a> film The Unbreakable Boy, which has had its release date pushed back from March 2022. It’s unknown when it will appear in theaters.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dominic Fumusa (Kevin Peyton)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1461458648.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Jackie’s long suffering husband Kevin is played by Dominic Fumusa. Kevin owns a bar and is a pretty decent father to his and Jackie’s two daughters, as well as being a sweet husband. But once he discovers his wife’s infidelities and drug issues his charm hardens into something much meaner.</p><p data-characters=653 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Fumusa had a decent amount of exposure before his role in Nurse Jackie. He ran the usual actor gauntlet of shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law and Order</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CSI</a>, and even had a few appearances in great series like The Sopranos and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sex and the City</a>. Since his role as Kevin ended, Fumusa has been incredibly busy, working across both television and film. He had recurring parts in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Homeland</a> and the television adaptation of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taken</a>, and acted alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Driver</a> in the 2019 film The Report. Currently he’s working on two television shows, Godfather of Harlem on Epix, and the CBS reboot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Equalizer</a>, where he plays a detective on the tail of the titular character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Betty Gilpin (Dr. Carrie Roman)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Betty-Gilpin.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Although she only appeared in the final three seasons of Nurse Jackie, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Betty Gilpin</a> gave a standout performance as the morally dubious, promiscuous doctor Carrie Roman. Throughout her run in the series she manages to manipulate men — specifically Coop — into picking up her slack, although she eventually becomes pregnant with his baby, leading to the pair settling down.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=false>While Nurse Jackie was a great springboard for Gilpin’s career, things really took off for her in 2017 when she was cast opposite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alison Brie</a> in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GLOW</a>. She’ll be on the small screen in two different shows in the coming year: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrs. Davis</a>, in which she’ll star as a nun using her religion to confront problems around AI, and one of the three leads in Three Women, based on the 2019 nonfiction book of the same name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnKxlpJ2ybq%2FArKtmp5Ziu7a%2B0p5ko5mToLamec2ormg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-chandler-dewgard-from-the-bachelor-season-28.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Chandler Dewgard from The Bachelor season 28?">&larr;
