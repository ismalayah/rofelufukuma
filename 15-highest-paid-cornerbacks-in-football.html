The LA Rams signed him to a 5-year, $105 million extension, making him an upper echelon of CB earners. He earns $20 million per year with this agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>Although playing for the Dolphins in 2023, he is still well-loved by the Rams fans. His 4-year career at the Rams saw him make 10 interceptions and 47 pass deflections. He also assisted the Rams to their Super Bowl championship in 2022.</p><h2 id=marlon-humphrey><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-marlon-humphrey></span> 4. Marlon Humphrey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p data-sourcepos=4:1-4:77>Marlon Humphrey holds the 4th spot on the highest-paid cornerback list. The Ravens star earns an average annual salary of $19.5 million from his five-year, $97.5 million contract extension signed in 2020.</p><p data-sourcepos=4:1-4:77>He’s earned his paycheck through his consistent performance as a shutdown CB and playmaking threat. Humphrey has racked up three Pro Bowl selections in the past four years. He also received an All-Pro nod in 2019.</p><p data-sourcepos=4:1-4:77>The Ravens star is also a ball-hawking machine, with a league-leading eight forced fumbles in the 2020 season.

He earns 19.4 million on an annual basis, just behind Humphrey.</p><p>Drafted in 2020 as a 2nd rounder, Diggs wasn’t initially considered a top prospect.

Marshon Lattimore<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:731>New Orleans Saints star Marshon Lattimore, the shutdown corner terrorizing NFL wideouts, has locked down one of the league’s fattest paychecks. His $97 million extension in 2021 makes him one of the highest-paid CBs, and for good reason.</p><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:731>He earns 19.4 million on an annual basis, becoming on par with the wages of Cowboys’ Trevon Diggs.</p><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:731>Since his 2017 debut, Lattimore’s been a backfield menace, racking up 4 Pro Bowls and the Defensive Rookie of the Year honors.
