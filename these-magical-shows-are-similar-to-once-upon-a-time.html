Jennifer Morrison snagged the leading role of Emma Swan, a woman who realizes she must finally confront her demons after the son she gave up for adoption reappears in her life. He tries to convince her that she has a magical connection to Snow White and Prince Charming, but it takes her a long time to finally connect the dots. Eventually, she realizes that the magical fairytale characters are actually her biological parents. There are so many interesting twists and turns to enjoy in Once Upon a Time.

He came from a long line of warriors who devoted themselves to justice, and members of his bloodline always dedicated themselves to defending the city they resided in from evil mythical creatures. In every episode of the show, Nick faces off against external forces that are half-human, half-animal.

Its premise revolves around a teenage girl who learns a shocking secret about herself on her birthday; she discovers that she isn’t the typical human like she always believed. In fact, she is actually a human-angel hybrid, sent down to Earth to hunt demonic spirits.

It includes many different mythical creatures, making it easily comparable to a show like Once Upon a Time. TVD stars Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder, and Paul Wesley in the leading roles. They play characters stuck in a messy love triangle for a large portion of the series, but eventually, they are collectively able to decide which pairing is fate. Audiences were beguiled by the magical captivation of this series, which is what allowed it to go on for eight successful seasons.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>The Vampire Diaries can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Legacies (2018)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=568 data-current-count=915 data-injectable=true>Legacies is a spin-off series that stems from The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. It focuses on a new generation of protectors residing in Mystic Falls. They attend the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted and figure out how to control their powers as vampires, werewolves, and witches. Instead of giving in to villainous impulses, they must learn how to control their urges to follow an ethical code. Since this show is a spin-off based around two successful series, fans had extremely high expectations for it — and the show creators never let anyone down.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Legacies can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CW</a> or rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Witches of East End (2013)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>Witches of East End is a fascinating supernatural drama that premiered in 2013.

When the younger members of the family realize they have magical powers, it turns their lives upside down. Afterwards, the bizarre occurrences that have happened to them for their whole lives begin to make sense, but harnessing their powers for good comes with its own challenges.</p><p data-characters=56 data-current-count=56 data-injectable=false>Witches of East End can be rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Switched at Birth (2011)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>In Once Upon a Time, the main character gives up her son for adoption before reconnecting with him some 10 years later.

The plot revolves around Chandler, a woman who was once saved by a mysterious man that disappeared thereafter. The “Beast” believes himself to be a menace to society; he harbors a dark secret about a strange medical condition that causes him to turn into a monster. As the seres progresses, Chandler’s willingness to accept the cursed man ends up changing his life forever.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>Beauty and the Beast can be rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vudu</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow (2016)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=839 data-injectable=true>Just like in Once Upon a Time, DC‘s Legends of Tomorrow is filled with plenty of legendary characters. As both critical and commercial praise have proven, the Arrowverse typically produces entertaining storylines; Arrow, The Flash, and Supergirl have all received a lot of positive feedback over the years. DC‘s Legends of Tomorrow premiered in 2016 and ran for three seasons, focusing on a group of ragtag heroes who come together to stop supervillains in their tracks.</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>DC’s Legends of Tomorrow can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Teen Wolf (2011)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rCYDbefnmA</figure><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=929 data-injectable=true>For a long time, Teen Wolf was considered one of the most popular shows on MTV. The series follows a high school student named Scott McCall that encounters a vicious beast while taking a walk through the woods. He suffers a nasty bite, and nothing is ever the same for him as he must learn to control the urges that start taking over his body. At first, McCall is unsure if he can still consider himself a human or if he will completely transition into a werewolf. Ultimately, Scott turns what feels like a curse into a gift in order to protect the people closest to him.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>Teen Wolf can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a> or rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMSsnGalkZy2pK3LZqqhp6eoeqK%2BxGaqoqWZoa6zedOoZKimk5p6trzOp2SaZaSeuqZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anndi-mcafee-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-baywatch-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anndi McAfee Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband, Baywatch, Movies, Tv shows, and Net Worth.">&larr;
